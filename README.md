# Hi, I'm Tapasya 👋  

I’m an AI/ML engineer who enjoys building real systems — not just training models.  
Most of my work sits at the intersection of multimodal AI, semantic search, and practical LLM applications.

I’m deeply curious about how AI is evolving — especially how vision-language models, retrieval systems, and reasoning pipelines are becoming more capable and efficient. I enjoy experimenting with these ideas and turning them into working systems.

## What I Work On

- Multimodal systems (vision + language)
- Embedding-based semantic search
- Retrieval-augmented pipelines
- AI-powered catalog intelligence
- Backend-heavy ML integrations

## Selected Projects

### 🔍 Multimodal Image Search

Built an end-to-end image search system combining LLaMA-based caption generation, SBERT embeddings, and cosine similarity for semantic retrieval.

Designed with Azure Blob Storage and Azure Table Storage for scalable image and metadata handling, and structured as a production-style backend rather than a simple demo.
---

### 🤖 Multimodal Agent (LangGraph-based)
Designed a custom agent that:
- Grounds objects from images
- Generates structured captions
- Uses LLMs for reasoning
- Returns explainable outputs

The main goal was reducing hallucinations and improving object-level understanding.

---

### 🏷 AI Catalog Description Generator
A system that takes product images, extracts visual understanding, generates structured descriptions using LLMs, and stores everything for semantic retrieval.

Integrated with Azure Table Storage and embedding pipelines.

## Tech I Use Often

**Languages:** Python, SQL  
**Frameworks:** PyTorch, HuggingFace  
**Models:** CLIP, BLIP-2, SBERT, LLaMA  
**Cloud & Infra:** Azure SQL, Azure Table Storage  
**Other:** REST APIs, Streamlit, vector similarity search

## How I Think About Engineering

- Clean pipelines over quick hacks  
- Systems that scale, even if small at first  
- Practical deployment > theoretical perfection  
- Models are important — but integration matters more  

---

Currently exploring more efficient multimodal reasoning and structured captioning systems.

If you’re someone who enjoys building AI systems that actually ship — we’ll get along 🙂
